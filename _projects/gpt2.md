The model will complete the sentece as follows:

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have

requested that the directors of General Re and GE , the two largest private equity finance businesses in the country, be 
appointed to serve as its supervisory Chairman.  A number of 
issues that need to be addressed include the availability of 
capital, the need for a diverse group of shareholders to appropriate 
funds, and the need for an orderly and effective management 
succession process.  We are also filing a letter of intent with 
the SEC that will prompt them to propose new directors.  As we 
have previously stated, we want to incorporate both of the following 
ideas in new directorships.  In addition, we need a significant 
amount of shareholder interest in General Re, which we believe 
will be all but impossible in the near term.  To that end, General 
Re has been informed of our request for a successor.  We have not 
identified any specific date for the appointment of a successor. 
We are also seeking the participation of our Board members to 
provide certain governance tools.  If we do not receive the 
recommendations of the Board of Directors, we will not consider 
the appointment of a successor.  At Berkshire, we will not take any action
which could potentially hurt or hurt General Re’s shareholders.


Another sample


To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have 

led or are currently managing a team that will manage and implement 
Berkshire Hathaway shares. As a result of our commitment to manage 
and implement Berkshire Hathaway shares, we have acquired the extraordinary 
shares of common stock that we currently own.Berkshire currently owns 
approximately 88.5% of Berkshire common stock. Our Board of Directors 
has designated certain of our Board members, with the remaining remaining 
three to be chosen at the end of each year. The total number of members 
of the Board of Directors can be at an indefinite length determined by 
the Board, and our Board may exercise any number of executive, legislative, 
or other powers that are of such duration, and we may elect to elect the 
first member of this Board, so long as he or she remains active in the Board. 
The Board is also given the option to elect a number of additional members 
to the Board by option or by vote of the Board and may elect members by the 
vote of the Board.  In addition to electing additional members, the Board 
may vote  to approve or reject certain transactions, initiatives, actions, 
or initiatives in the future.

Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently,

customers have been under-represented in our shopping experience. And, my responsibility 
as CEO is to provide them with the best selection and the most affordable and candid prices. 
In my senior year, the chain’s design took center stage. In a matter of months, we broke 
the record in the U.S., and the record in Australia. We are now a world-class retailer that 
has made several acquisitions and will never be eclipsed by our competitors. In 2004, we 
acquired a 38-acre site in Massachusetts that is now the largest in North America. Our 
future is bright, as our world-class store will be forever enriched by the people who love 
it. Our shopping centers will be long-term investments in building on our success.  The 
business of a decade ago will be meaningless now.



Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently,
many of my mistakes have hurt my reputation and hurt my credit, employment 
and state-legal standing.  Some of these mistakes will not be repeated.  
But they are certain to be repeated.  A key lesson in this process of 
re-evaluation is that a single mistake has critical consequences, and that 
time cannot be wasted on misstatements regarding credit, credit quality or litigation.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY PRODUCTS INC.

states, including 28 wholesale stores, serving more than 1 billion customers.  
Pre-tax earnings of the stores is approximately $2.5 billion.
