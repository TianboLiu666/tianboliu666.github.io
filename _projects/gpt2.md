## Some examples of newly generately text iminating imitating warren buffett's writings.

 To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 
 Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have requested that the directors of General Re and GE , the two largest private equity finance businesses in the country, be appointed to serve as its supervisory Chairman.  A number of issues that need to be addressed include the availability of capital, the need for a diverse group of shareholders to appropriate funds, and the need for an orderly and effective management succession process.  We are also filing a letter of intent with the SEC that will prompt them to propose new directors.  As we have previously stated, we want to incorporate both of the following ideas in new directorships.  In addition, we need a significant amount of shareholder interest in General Re, which we believe will be all but impossible in the near term.  To that end, General Re has been informed of our request for a successor.  We have not identified any specific date for the appointment of a successor. We are also seeking the participation of our Board members to provide certain governance tools.  If we do not receive the recommendations of the Board of Directors, we will not consider the appointment of a successor.  At Berkshire, we will not take any action 
which could potentially hurt or hurt General Re’s shareholders.

 To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 
 Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have led or are currently managing a team that will manage and implement Berkshire Hathaway shares. As a result of our commitment to manage and implement Berkshire Hathaway shares, we have acquired the extraordinary shares of common stock that we currently own.Berkshire currently owns approximately 88.5% of Berkshire common stock. Our Board of Directors has designated certain of our Board members, with the remaining remaining three to be chosen at the end of each year. The total number of members of the Board of Directors can be at an indefinite length determined by the Board, and our Board may exercise any number of executive, legislative, or other powers that are of such duration, and we may elect to elect the first member of this Board, so long as he or she remains active in the Board. The Board is also given the option to elect a number of additional members to the Board by option or by vote of the Board and may elect members by the vote of the Board.  In addition to electing additional members, the Board may vote  to approve or reject certain transactions, initiatives, actions, or initiatives in the future.

 ```bash
Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, 
customers have been under-represented in our shopping experience. And, my responsibility as CEO is to provide them with the best selection and the most affordable and candid prices. In my senior year, the chain’s design took center stage. In a matter of months, we broke the record in the U.S., and the record in Australia. We are now a world-class retailer that has made several acquisitions and will never be eclipsed by our competitors. In 2004, we acquired a 38-acre site in Massachusetts that is now the largest in North America. Our future is bright, as our world-class store will be forever enriched by the people who love it. Our shopping centers will be long-term investments in building on our success.  The business of a decade ago will be meaningless now.

 Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, 
many of my mistakes have hurt my reputation and hurt my credit, employment and state- 
legal standing.  Some of these mistakes will not be repeated.  But they are 
certain to be repeated.  A key lesson in this process of re-evaluation is that a single mistake has critical consequences, 
and that time cannot be wasted on misstatements regarding credit, credit quality or litigation.
