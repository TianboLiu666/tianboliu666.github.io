<h1>Hi, I'm Tianbo.</h1>

I like quantitative subjects and have a solid background in mathematics.

Recently, I have been fascinated by generative models, like GPTs, Llama 2, Mixtral etc.

<!-- After figuring out the theoretical aspects of these models,  -->
I have built some full stack RAG Web applications utilizing some open source(weights) models and APIs.  I am working on fast and low cost inference of open weights models.

Hope to build things useful and people like them<
